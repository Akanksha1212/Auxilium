# Auxilium
An application where the users can engage with people who need help and then extend their help and support to the community. 

## What is does?
The main functionalities include the following:

1)Ask help: In this part, potential help-seekers can post their respective problems which they need help with, along with their contact details. These will be compiled and will be posted in the “Help Others” tab.

2)Help Others: Once the help required by others is posted, they will be displayed here where people willing to do some philanthropy or those who want to help a fellow community member out, can look through the various requests posted by others and contact them in case they are willing or able to provide the help required by the help-seekers.

3)Activities: Now, these are incorporated to instill a healthy and competitive nature within the community to accept and complete certain tasks that are designed to be good for both the community and nature, which once completed, will result in the accumulation of points that go towards ranking the individual on the leader board.

4)Events: Various events such as cultural, recreational, etc. can be listed in order to create a sense of community and togetherness among the users. They can make use of this feature to conduct several meetups too. These events can be looked upon by the user, and if they interest them, they can add it to their calendar to set a reminder for the event.
